# Universal Zoning System (UZS)

## ⚠️ BETA DISCLAIMER ⚠️

**This mod is in early testing phase. Please note:**
- ⚠️ Not fully tested with all game scenarios
- ⚠️ May cause issues with existing savegames
- ⚠️ Backup your saves before using
- ⚠️ Use at your own risk
- 🐛 Please report bugs on GitHub

## ⚠️ NOT SAFE TO REMOVE

**This mod CANNOT be safely removed once you have buildings in Universal zones!**

When you disable this mod, any buildings that were built in Universal zones will lose their zone assignment. This will cause:
- Buildings to become "orphaned" without proper zoning
- Potential save corruption or errors
- Loss of buildings in Universal-zoned areas

**To uninstall safely:**
1. Replace ALL Universal zones with standard NA or EU zones first
2. Wait several in-game days for buildings to adapt
3. Demolish any remaining Universal-zoned buildings
4. Save your game and verify it loads correctly
5. Only then disable the mod

**Once you use this mod, consider it a permanent part of your save file.**

## What does this mod do?

The Universal Zoning System addresses a restriction in the base game where zoning is strictly segregated by "Theme" (North American vs. European). This segregation forces players to manually toggle themes or paint specific districts to achieve architectural variety.

UZS creates a unified "Universal" zoning palette. When you zone "Universal Low Density Residential," the game can randomly spawn a Victorian NA home next to a Modern EU cottage, creating organic diversity.

## Features

- **8 Universal Zone Types**: New zones that accept both NA and EU buildings
- **Customizable Probabilities**: Adjust spawn chances for different building types through mod settings
- **No Theme Switching**: Build mixed-style neighborhoods without constantly changing themes
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing saves and other mods

## Available Universal Zones

- Universal Low Density Residential
- Universal Row Housing
- Universal Medium Density Residential
- Universal High Density Residential
- Universal Low Rent Housing
- Universal Mixed Housing
- Universal Low Density Commercial
- Universal High Density Commercial

## Configuration

Open the mod settings to fine-tune the probability of different building styles appearing in your universal zones. Set any style to 0% to exclude it completely, or 100% for maximum variety!

## How to Use

1. Enable the mod in your mod manager
2. Start or load a city
3. Open the zoning tool
4. Find the new "Universal" zones in your palette
5. Zone as normal - mixed buildings will spawn automatically!
6. Adjust probabilities in mod settings if desired

## ⚠️ Important: Removal Warning

This mod modifies core game zoning data. Buildings created in Universal zones depend on this mod to function correctly. Removing the mod without first converting all zones back to standard zones will break those buildings and may corrupt your save.

**Think of this mod as a permanent architectural expansion pack for your city.**

## Known Issues

- Still in testing phase
- Potential compatibility issues with other zone mods
- May affect game performance in large cities
- **Cannot be safely removed once buildings are placed in Universal zones**
